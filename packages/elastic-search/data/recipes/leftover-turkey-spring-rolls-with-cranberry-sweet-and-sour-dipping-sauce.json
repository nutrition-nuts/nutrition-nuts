    "summary": "This lends classic Asian flavors with an all-American twist. I suggest enlisting the help of a couple of people rolling the spring rolls. This takes up the majority of the prep time. I bake the rolls instead of frying them to cut down on the calories, but you can deep fry them for extra flavor. If you can't find spring roll wrappers, use the egg roll wrappers. They don't bake well, so deep-fry them instead. Use real soy sauce brewed from soybeans, and not the stuff with caramel coloring and salt.",

        "\u00bd  carrot, minced",
        "2 cloves garlic, minced",
        "\u215b teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "\u215b teaspoon ground ginger",
        "\u215b teaspoon garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash\u00ae)",
        "5 tablespoons soy sauce",
        "6 cups finely shredded cabbage",
        "\u00bd teaspoon oyster sauce  (Optional)",
        "50 (7 inch square) egg roll wrappers",
        "\u00bc cup jellied cranberry sauce",
        "\u00bc cup white sugar",
        "\u00bc cup white vinegar",
        "1 dash soy sauce"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Heat the olive oil and sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers",
        "Cook and stir the turkey, carrot, garlic, black pepper, ginger, and garlic and herb seasoning until the garlic releases its fragrance, about 2 minutes",
        "Stir in 2 tablespoons of the soy sauce, and continue cooking until the carrot begins to soften, about 5 minutes",
        "Stir in the cabbage, oyster sauce, and remaining 3 tablespoons of soy sauce",
        "Continue to stir, until the cabbage is soft and cooked through, about 10 minutes",
        "Remove the mixture from the heat, and set aside",
        "Drain off any excess liquid",
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)",
        "Line several baking sheets with parchment paper",
        "To fill the wrappers, separate and place the spring roll wrappers onto your work surface, with the points of the square pointing up and down in a diamond shape",
        "Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the turkey filling in a line across the center of the wrapper, and fold the bottom point up to cover the filling",
        "Fold the two side points in on top of the folded wrapper, to fully enclose the filling",
        "The two side points should be about 1 inch apart",
        "Firmly but gently, roll the spring roll into a tight cylinder, and roll the wrapper over to firmly press down the remaining point",
        "Set the filled wrappers seam-side down onto the parchment-lined baking sheets so they don't touch",
        "The rolls should be about the thickness of a finger",
        "Bake the filled rolls in the preheated oven until they begin to brown, about 15 minutes",
        "Mash the cranberry sauce in a saucepan over medium heat until the sauce is smooth, then whisk in the sugar, vinegar, and a dash of soy sauce",
        "Bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer, whisking the sauce, until the sugar has dissolved and the sauce reduces and thickens slightly, about 10 minutes",
        "Remove sauce to a bowl",
        "Serve the rolls hot with the sauce"
